# Random User Challenge

## Requirement

This is your opportunity to show off. Your only requirement:

Create an application where I can click a button and get information on a random user
using the [RandomUser.me](http://randomuser.me) api.

I would roughly (very roughly, you have all the flexibility in the world here) expect something like this mock:

## Additional Instructions

- Please fork this repo and build the app out of it.
- Use any library/framework/etc. you want or none at all.
- There is no time limit/expectation. Take as much time as you need to make it as awesome as you want it to be.
- Please update the README with build instructions

Good luck! You'll do great!
